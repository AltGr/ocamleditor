OCamlEditor is a source code editor and build tool for the OCaml
programming language.

It provides many features to facilitate editing code, accessing API
reference directly from the editor and compiling projects. It is entirely
written in OCaml and uses LablGtk for the graphical user interface; it is
light-weight, free and open source and works on Linux and Windows.

HOW TO COMPILE

  Change to the OCamlEditor toplevel directory and execute:

  Under Windows with MSVC execute:

    ocaml build.ml ocamleditor-msvc

  If the native code compiler is not available on your platform, compile with:

    ocaml build.ml ocamleditor-bytecode

  The name of the command is "ocamleditor.opt" (or "ocamleditor" if the
  native compilation is not supported), you can find it in the "src"
  directory.


INSTALLATION

  Since OCamlEditor-1.9.0 installation paths differs from that of previous
  version, so please uninstall it by doing:

    ocaml build.ml uninstall -ver-1.8.0 [-prefix <path>]

  To install OCamlEditor become superuser and execute:

    ocaml build.ml install [-prefix <path>]

  By default, commands will be installed under "/usr/local/bin", icons
  under "/usr/local/share/ocamleditor/icons" and plugins under
  "/usr/local/share/ocamleditor/icons". You can specify an installation
  prefix other than "/usr/local" by giving an absolute file name as argument.

  Windows users may build an installer by compiling the included NSIS
  script, "ocamleditor.nsi". The free NSIS install system can be found at
  http://nsis.sourceforge.net


DEVELOPMENT

  The main page for development is hosted on the OCaml Forge, see the
  project's page:

    https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/ocamleditor

  You can browse the source tree from:

    https://forge.ocamlcore.org/scm/browser.php?group_id=141

  or clone it by doing:

  * The most common application settings are accessible from the
    Preferences window, however other options may be changed by editing
    "oe_config.ml" before compiling.
  * The program creates a folder named ".ocamleditor" in your HOME
