OCamlEditor is a source code editor and build tool for the OCaml
programming language.

It provides many features to facilitate editing code, accessing API
reference directly from the editor and compiling projects. It is entirely
written in OCaml and uses LablGtk for the graphical user interface; it is
light-weight, free and open source and works on Linux and Windows.

DEPENDENCIES

  * OCaml-4.00.0;
  * Lablgtk-2.16.0 (installed with Findlib);
  * Xml-light (installed at "+xml-light");
  * Findlib-1.3.3.


HOW TO COMPILE

  Change to the OCamlEditor toplevel directory and execute:

    ocaml build.ml ocamleditor

  If the native code compiler is not available on your platform, compile with:

    ocaml build.ml ocamleditor-bytecode

  The name of the command is "ocamleditor.opt" (or "ocamleditor" if the
  native compilation is not supported), you can find it in the "src"
  directory.


INSTALLATION

  For Linux, become superuser and execute:

    ocaml tools/install.ml [-prefix <path>]

  By default, commands will be installed under "/usr/local/bin" and icons
  under "/usr/local/share/pixmaps/ocamleditor". You can specify an
  installation prefix other than "/usr/local" by giving an absolute file
  name as argument.

  Windows users may build an installer by compiling the included NSIS
  script, "ocamleditor.nsi". The free NSIS install system can be found at
  http://nsis.sourceforge.net


DEVELOPMENT

  The main page for development is hosted on the OCaml Forge, see the
  project's page:

    https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/ocamleditor

  You can browse the source tree from:

    https://forge.ocamlcore.org/scm/browser.php?group_id=141

  or clone it by doing:

    git clone https://forge.ocamlcore.org/anonscm/git/ocamleditor/ocamleditor.git


NOTES

  * The most common application settings are accessible from the
    Preferences window, however other options may be changed by editing
    "oe_config.ml" before compiling.
  * The program creates a folder named ".ocamleditor" in your HOME
    directory with informations like preferences, recently opened
    projects, etc.
