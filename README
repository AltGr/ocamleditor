DEPENDENCIES

  * Objective Caml 3.12.1 with the compiler libraries available from the
    OCaml source distribution;
  * Lablgtk-2.14.2;
  * Xml-light.


HOW TO COMPILE

  Compile the OCaml source tree, then change to the OCamlEditor toplevel
  directory and edit the "Configuration Section" at the beginning of
  "build.ml", following the comments in that file. Then, do:

    ln -s /path/to/ocaml/compiled/sources src/ocaml-src
    ocaml build.ml

  The name of the command is "ocamleditor.opt" (or "ocamleditor" if the
  native compilation is not supported), you can find it in the "src"
  directory.


HOW TO COMPILE without having to build the entire OCaml source tree
(for example under Windows if you're using the MSVC version of OCaml):

  Edit the "Configuration Section" at the beginning of "build.ml", following
  the comments in that file. Then, do:

    mkdir src\ocaml-src

  Download from http://caml.inria.fr/ the source tarball corresponding to
  your OCaml version installed and copy the directories "utils", "parsing"
  and "typing" to the newly created "ocaml-src" directory; then from the
  OCamlEditor toplevel directory compile with:

    ocaml build.ml -with-compiler-libs

  Under Windows the name of the command is "ocamleditor.opt.exe" (or
  "ocamleditor.bat" if the native compilation is not supperted), you can
  find it in the "src" directory.


INSTALLATION

  For Linux, become superuser and run:

    ocaml build.ml -install [-prefix <path>]

  By default, commands will be installed under "/usr/local/bin" and icons
  under "/usr/local/share/pixmaps/ocamleditor". You can specify an
  installation prefix other than "/usr/local" by giving an absolute file
  name as argument.

  Windows users may build an installer by compiling the included NSIS
  script, "ocamleditor.nsi". The free NSIS install system can be found at
  http://nsis.sourceforge.net


DEVELOPMENT

  The main page for development is hosted on the OCaml Forge, see the
  project's page:

    https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/ocamleditor

  The public git repository is hosted on github. You can browse the source
  tree from:

    http://github.com/ftovagliari/ocamleditor

  or clone it by doing:

    git clone git://github.com/ftovagliari/ocamleditor.git


NOTES

  * The most common application settings are accessible from the
    Preferences window, however other options may be changed by editing
    "oe_config.ml" before compiling.
  * The program creates a folder named ".ocamleditor" in your HOME
    directory with informations like preferences, recently opened
    projects, etc.
